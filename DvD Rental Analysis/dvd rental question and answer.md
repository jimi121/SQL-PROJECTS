### Insight:
1. **Genre Diversity:** The Film industry has a diverse collection of 16 unique genres, indicating that they cater to a wide range of customer preferences.

2. **Top Performer (Sports):** The sports genre is the most popular among customers, with a total rental count of 1,179 and generating the highest total sales revenue of $4,892.19. This suggests a strong demand for sports-related content, which could be further leveraged for marketing and content acquisition.

3. **Least Popular (Music):** The music genre is the least rented, with only 830 rentals and the lowest total sales revenue of $3,071.52. This indicates that there might be an opportunity to improve the selection or promotion of music-related content to boost rentals and sales.

4. **Popular Genres (Animation, Action, Sci-Fi):** Animation, action, and sci-fi genres also perform well in terms of rental counts and total sales. These genres might warrant special attention in terms of content acquisition and promotion to maximize revenue.

5. **Potential for Improvement (Music and Classics):** Genres like music and classics have room for improvement in terms of rental counts and total sales. Strategies to increase the appeal of these genres, such as offering exclusive content or targeted marketing, could be explored.

In summary, this analysis not only identifies the top and least rented genres but also provides valuable insights for optimizing the content catalog and marketing strategies to enhance rental counts and total sales across various genres.


#### 2. Can we know how many distinct users have rented each genre ?
```sql
SELECT
	c.name AS genre,
	count(DISTINCT c2.customer_id) AS total_rent
FROM
	category c
JOIN film_category fc
		USING(category_id)
JOIN film f
		USING(film_id)
JOIN inventory i
		USING(film_id)
JOIN rental r
		USING(inventory_id)
JOIN customer c2
		USING(customer_id)
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	2 DESC
```

### Results:
|genre      |total_rent|
|-----------|----------|
|Sports     |519       |

|Travel     |442       |

### Insights:
1. **Distinct Customer Engagement:** The analysis focuses on understanding how many distinct customers have engaged with each genre, providing insights into the diversity of customer preferences.

2. **Travel Genre Surprises:** It's noteworthy that the travel genre, despite having a relatively low total rental count, has the lowest number of distinct customers. This suggests that while fewer people may rent travel-related content, those who do are more likely to engage with this genre multiple times. This could indicate a niche audience with a strong interest in travel content.

3. **Repeat Rentals in Travel:** Building upon the previous point, the higher number of repeat rentals in the travel genre might be due to the evergreen nature of travel content. Customers could be revisiting travel documentaries or shows for inspiration or planning purposes, even multiple times.

4. **Sports Genre Popularity:** The sports genre stands out not only for having a high total rental count but also for attracting the highest number of distinct customers. This indicates a broad and dedicated audience interested in sports-related content, which could be leveraged for targeted marketing and content expansion in this genre.

5. **Opportunities for Music Genre:** Despite having fewer total rentals compared to some genres, the music genre has attracted a relatively high number of distinct customers. This suggests an opportunity to further promote and diversify the music genre's content to increase rental counts and revenue.

6. **Customer Engagement Strategy:** These insights can help in tailoring marketing and content acquisition strategies. For example, for genres like travel and music, there could be strategies to engage repeat customers, while for popular genres like sports, efforts could focus on expanding the customer base.

In summary, this analysis not only provides information about the number of distinct customers for each genre but also highlights the unique characteristics of customer engagement with different genres, which can inform strategies to maximize customer satisfaction and revenue in each genre.



#### 3. What is the average rental rate for each genre?
```sql
SELECT
	c.name AS genre,
	round(avg(f.rental_rate),2) AS avg_rental_rate
FROM
	category c
JOIN film_category fc
		USING(category_id)
JOIN film f
		USING(film_id)
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	2 DESC;
```

### Results:
|genre      |avg_rental_rate|
|-----------|---------------|
|Games      |3.25           |
|Travel     |3.24           |
|Sci-Fi     |3.22           |
|Comedy     |3.16           |
|Sports     |3.13           |
|New        |3.12           |
|Foreign    |3.1            |
|Horror     |3.03           |
|Drama      |3.02           |
|Music      |2.95           |
|Children   |2.89           |
|Animation  |2.81           |
|Family     |2.76           |
|Classics   |2.74           |
|Documentary|2.67           |
|Action     |2.65           |


### Insights:
1. **Consumer Behavior and Price Sensitivity:** The data suggests that consumer behavior in choosing a rental is not solely driven by the average rental rate. This implies that factors such as genre preference, movie availability, and personal interests play a significant role in rental decisions.

2. **Game Genre Anomaly:** Despite having the lowest average rental rate, the game genre is among the top five most rented genres. This could indicate a strong and dedicated audience for gaming content. Consider exploring opportunities to expand the game genre catalog or offer special promotions to further leverage this popularity.

3. **Action Genre Popularity:** The Action genre, with the highest average rental rate, remains one of the most rented genres. This challenges the assumption that higher rates deter rentals in all cases. It's possible that customers are willing to pay more for high-quality action films. Leveraging this popularity, you might consider acquiring more premium action content or exclusive releases.

4. **Audience Preferences:** The variation in average rental rates across genres also reflects differences in audience preferences. For instance, customers might be more price-sensitive when it comes to genres like Family, Children, or Animation, but less so for genres like Action or Games. This can inform pricing strategies and content acquisition decisions.

5. **Opportunities in Music and Classics:** The Music and Classics genres have relatively low average rental rates, and the data suggests they are not among the most rented genres. There could be opportunities to enhance the content offerings in these genres or explore pricing strategies to attract more rentals.

6. **Competition and Market Trends:** Understanding how different genres perform in terms of rental rates and frequency can help in competitive positioning and adapting to changing market trends. Monitoring these trends over time can provide insights into evolving customer preferences.

In summary, the analysis of the average rental rates for each genre reveals that consumer behavior is influenced by various factors beyond just price. Genre preferences, content quality, and audience interests are crucial considerations in shaping your content acquisition and pricing strategies.



#### 4. How many rental films were returned late, early and on time?
```sql
--4. How many rental films were returned late, early and on time?
WITH t1 AS (SELECT
				*,
				date_part('day',
				return_date - rental_date) AS date_difference
			FROM
				rental
			),
	 t2 AS (SELECT
				CASE
					WHEN rental_duration > date_difference THEN 'Returned early'
					WHEN rental_duration = date_difference THEN 'Returned On Time'
					ELSE 'Returned late'
					END AS Return_status
			FROM
				film
			JOIN inventory
					USING(film_id)
			JOIN t1
					USING(inventory_id)
			),
	t3 AS (SELECT
				Return_status,
				count(*) AS total
			FROM
				t2
			GROUP BY
				1
			ORDER BY
				2 DESC)
SELECT
	Return_status,
	total,
	concat((round(total /(SELECT sum(total) FROM t3)*100,0)),'%') AS total_pct
FROM
	t3
GROUP BY
	1,
	2
ORDER BY
	2 DESC;
```

### Results:
|return_status   |total|total_pct|
|----------------|-----|---------|
|Returned early  |7,738|48%      |
|Returned late   |6,586|41%      |
|Returned On Time|1,720|11%      |

### Insights:
* **Return Statistics:**
    * Based on the query results, we find that:
        * 48% of movies are returned earlier than the due date.
        * 41% of movies are returned late.
        * 11% of movies arrive on time.
* **Complex Factors at Play:**
    * Several factors might contribute to these patterns, such as shipping distances beyond customer control.
        * For example, customers who live further away from the rental store may be more likely to return movies late.
        * Additionally, customers who are busy or forgetful may also be more likely to return movies late.
* **Deeper Analysis Needed:**
    * Further exploration of the data is required to uncover the underlying issues.
        * This could involve analyzing customer demographics, rental patterns, and other factors.
* **Potential for Penalty Fees:**
    * Notably, a significant portion of movies are returned late. Consideration of a late return penalty fee as an additional revenue source is warranted.
        * However, the implementation of such a policy should be informed by a deeper understanding of why late returns occur.
        * For example, if late returns are due to factors beyond the customer's control, such as shipping delays, then a penalty fee may not be fair.
* **Conclusion:**
    * The insights presented in this document provide a valuable starting point for understanding movie return status. Further analysis is needed to uncover the underlying issues and develop strategies to improve the return rate.

### Insight:

1. **Market Size Variation:** The data illustrates a significant variation in both customer base and total sales across countries. This indicates that the DVD rental industry's performance is closely tied to the specific market conditions in each country.

2. **Revenue Discrepancies:** It's worth noting that countries with larger customer bases don't always have the highest total sales. For instance, China has a substantial customer base but slightly lower total sales compared to India. This suggests that factors such as rental pricing, customer preferences, and market competition play a role in revenue generation.

3. **Untapped Markets:** Countries with small customer bases like Afghanistan, Nauru, and Tonga might represent untapped or emerging markets for the DVD rental industry. Exploring strategies to expand and attract more customers in these regions could be an opportunity for growth.

4. **Market Saturation:** On the other hand, countries with larger customer bases like India and China might indicate relatively mature markets for DVD rentals. Strategies for retaining and satisfying existing customers, as well as attracting new ones, become essential in such markets.

In conclusion, this data provides valuable insights into the global presence of the DVD rental industry. Understanding the nuances of each market can help guide strategic decisions related to customer acquisition, retention, and revenue optimization in different countries.

### Insights:
This table above shows all the customers that have not returned their DvD back to the industry.

The reason why this happened is because most of the customers did not know their return date.

The industry should try to update the data by putting the treturn date to where it is empty.


# Conclusions:

**Genre Diversity and Customer Preferences:**

* The DVD rental industry caters to a diverse audience, offering a wide range of 16 unique genres. This diversity is a positive sign as it accommodates various customer preferences.

**Genre Performance:**

* The sports genre stands out as the top performer, with the highest rental count and total sales revenue. It's crucial to recognize and leverage this genre's popularity for marketing and content acquisition.

* Conversely, the music genre lags behind in rentals and revenue, indicating room for improvement. Strategies to enhance the selection and promotion of music-related content could boost rentals and sales.

* Animation, action, and sci-fi genres also perform well. These genres deserve special attention for maximizing revenue potential.

* Genres like classics and music have potential for improvement. Strategies to increase their appeal, such as exclusive content or targeted marketing, could be explored.

**Consumer Behavior and Price Sensitivity:**

* Rental decisions are influenced by factors beyond the average rental rate, highlighting the significance of genre preference, content availability, and personal interests in consumer behavior.

**Store Performance:**

* The data provides a month-by-month comparison of rental order processing for two stores. It's evident that both stores experience fluctuations in rental order volumes, and understanding these patterns can inform inventory and staffing decisions.

**Customer DVD Returns:**

* The table lists customers who have not returned DVDs, primarily due to missing return dates. To address this, updating the data with return dates can help ensure timely returns.

**Overall Strategy:**

These conclusions emphasize the need for a strategic approach that considers customer preferences, genre performance, and store dynamics. Leveraging popular genres, optimizing content catalogs, and addressing missing data are all essential steps in maximizing revenue and customer satisfaction in the DVD rental industry.


## Recommendation:

**Genre Recommendations:**
