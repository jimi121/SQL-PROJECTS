# Introduction

In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploration of the  DVD Rental database. This database contains valuable information about a DVD rental company. Throughout this project, I utilized a series of queries to unearth insights into various aspects of the business. I delved into understanding customer behavior, payment earnings, and the performance of different stores within the company.

To facilitate our analysis, I harnessed the power of the DVD Rental database schema, as outlined in the `dvd-rental-erd-2.pdf` document.

# **Project Objectives and Goals**

In this project, the primary aim is to address a series of key questions that provide valuable insights into the DVD rental industry. Each question serves as a specific goal, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the industry's performance and customer behavior. These objectives include:

1. **Genre Analysis:** Determine the most and least rented genres while also assessing their total sales, shedding light on the industry's revenue drivers.

2. **Customer Engagement:** Explore how many distinct users have engaged with each genre, indicating the diversity of customer preferences and interests.

3. **Pricing Strategy:** Analyze the average rental rate for each genre, uncovering potential correlations between pricing and rental popularity.

4. **Rental Return Patterns:** Investigate the distribution of rental film returns in terms of being early, late, or on time, allowing for insights into customer punctuality.

5. **Global Sales and Customer Base:** Examine the total sales and customer base in each country where the DVD rental industry is established, providing a holistic view of its global presence.

6. **Top Customer Recognition:** Identify the top 5 customers based on total sales and provide their detailed information, facilitating customer appreciation and retention strategies.

7. **Family Genre Insights:** Determine the most-watched movie genres among families, focusing on Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family, and Music, catering to family-oriented content preferences.

8. **Store Performance:** Uncover in which months each store processed the highest total number of rental orders, aiding in staffing and inventory management.

9. **Non-Returned DVDs:** Provide details of customers who have not returned DVDs, shedding light on potential operational issues and areas for improvement.

By addressing these objectives, this project aims to offer a comprehensive and data-driven perspective on the DVD rental industry, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and optimize their business strategies.

## Setting Up Your Local Environment

If you're interested in replicating our analysis locally, here's a step-by-step guide to setting up your environment with PostgreSQL and the Sakila database:

**Step 1: PostgreSQL Installation**
- Begin by installing PostgreSQL on your local machine. Depending on your operating system, follow the relevant instructions:
  - For Windows: [Installation Guide](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/)
  - For macOS: [Installation Guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/)
  
  During installation, be sure to note down the database superuser (postgres) password, as it will be necessary for creating the Sakila database.

**Step 2: Downloading the Database**
- After successfully installing PostgreSQL, proceed to download the database from this page: [PostgreSQL Sample Database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/).
- Locate the "Download DVD Rental Sample Database" button and click it. This action will download a compressed file, which you should extract to access the `dvdrental.tar` file.

**Step 3: Loading the Database**
- Now, it's time to load the DVD Rental database into your PostgreSQL server. We recommend using the PgAdmin tool for this task. Here are the detailed instructions: [Load PostgreSQL Sample Database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/load-postgresql-sample-database/).
- Follow the instructions provided under the section titled "Load the DVD Rental database using pgAdmin tool," and continue through the "Verify the loaded sample database."

By completing these steps, you will have successfully loaded the `dvdrental` sample database into your local PostgreSQL server.

**Step 4: Reconnecting to PostgreSQL Server**
- Relaunch the PgAdmin III application and select the PostgreSQL server within the Object browser. You will need to enter the superuser (postgres) password.

**Step 5: Connecting to the DVD Rental Database**
- In the Object browser, expand the Databases section to access the DVD rental database.

**Step 6: Choose the DVD Rental Database**

## Conclusions from the Analysis:

**Genre Diversity and Customer Preferences:**

* The DVD rental industry caters to a diverse audience, offering a wide range of 16 unique genres. This diversity is a positive sign as it accommodates various customer preferences.

**Genre Performance:**

* The sports genre stands out as the top performer, with the highest rental count and total sales revenue. It's crucial to recognize and leverage this genre's popularity for marketing and content acquisition.

* Conversely, the music genre lags behind in rentals and revenue, indicating room for improvement. Strategies to enhance the selection and promotion of music-related content could boost rentals and sales.

* Animation, action, and sci-fi genres also perform well. These genres deserve special attention for maximizing revenue potential.

* Genres like classics and music have potential for improvement. Strategies to increase their appeal, such as exclusive content or targeted marketing, could be explored.

**Consumer Behavior and Price Sensitivity:**

* Rental decisions are influenced by factors beyond the average rental rate, highlighting the significance of genre preference, content availability, and personal interests in consumer behavior.

**Store Performance:**

* The data provides a month-by-month comparison of rental order processing for two stores. It's evident that both stores experience fluctuations in rental order volumes, and understanding these patterns can inform inventory and staffing decisions.

**Customer DVD Returns:**

* The table lists customers who have not returned DVDs, primarily due to missing return dates. To address this, updating the data with return dates can help ensure timely returns.

* **Staffing Adjustments:** Align staffing levels with the expected order volumes. During peak months, hire temporary staff to handle increased demand, while scaling back during slower months to control costs.

**Customer DVD Returns:**

* **Data Integrity:** Ensure that return dates are consistently recorded for all rentals. Implement a reminder system to notify customers of upcoming return deadlines, reducing the number of late returns.
